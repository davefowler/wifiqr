# Building a WiFi QR Code Generator with Aider: A Journey in AI-Assisted Development

I recently found myself frustrated with the existing WiFi QR code generators available online. Most were either cluttered with ads, required unnecessary permissions, or just didn't have the clean, modern interface I was looking for. As someone who frequently needs to share WiFi credentials with guests, I decided to build my own solution - and the experience was surprisingly effortless thanks to AI assistance through Aider.

## The Power of AI-Assisted Development

What amazed me most was the speed and efficiency of development when working with Aider. The entire process felt like having a conversation with a knowledgeable developer who could instantly implement my ideas. I simply described what I wanted, and Aider helped me create it step by step.

The development process was remarkably smooth:
1. Started with a basic QR code generator
2. Added a modern WiFi icon using SVG
3. Implemented a clean, responsive design
4. Added features like password visibility toggle
5. Fine-tuned the layout with vertical centering
6. Created documentation and deployed to GitHub

Each iteration took just minutes, with Aider understanding both my explicit requests and implicit needs. When I wanted to center content or adjust spacing, it was as simple as asking in plain English.

## The Result

The final product is everything I wanted: a simple, clean, and efficient WiFi QR code generator that:
- Runs entirely in the browser (no server needed)
- Has a modern, minimalist interface
- Gives users control over password visibility
- Is mobile-friendly and easy to use
- Can be easily deployed and shared

## Why This Matters

This project exemplifies how AI is transforming software development. What might have taken days of coding, testing, and tweaking was accomplished in a fraction of the time. Aider handled everything from code generation to deployment guidance, making the entire process feel effortless.

The most impressive part wasn't just that it worked, but how it maintained best practices throughout - proper HTML structure, clean CSS, and efficient JavaScript. Each suggestion was thoughtful and considered the overall user experience.

## Looking Forward

This experience has changed how I think about small development projects. With tools like Aider, the barrier to creating custom solutions is lower than ever. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, AI assistance makes it possible to quickly turn ideas into reality.

The WiFi QR code generator is just one example, but it demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted development. It's exciting to think about what else we can build with these tools at our disposal.
